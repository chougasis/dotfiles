## Name
Chougasis' Arch/Hyprland Dotfiles

## Description
After using Hyprdots on Arch exclusively for my first 8 months of learning Linux, I decided to learn how to make my own Hyprland config and ended up learning a lot more. In the end, it is a pretty simple and generic rice, but I did manage to get it working. 
## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/chougasis/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
sh install.sh
```
